## Digital Science communication, past and present

Science communication didn't start with social media, or even the internet. Scientists working for government agencies have long given press conferences, testified in public hearings before legislatures, and given lectures and talks open to the public. And scientists were some of the first to make use of the internet.  But, online social media platforms give virtually any member of the public with an internet connection the opportunity to connect with *individual* scientists at virtually all hours of the day. Even university students don't have that kind of access to experts in a given field. 

### On the death of Science Twitter

Beginning with the announcement of Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter (insert date), many scientists who had become active on the platform in years prior became concerned about the future of their professional networks and communities they'd built. Several had great success in establishing a platform to communicate their results, discuss open questions in their fields with a perhaps unprecedented network of colleagues around the world, and (at least in theory) make academic science accessible to the public in a way that really hadn't existed before social media like it.  It was undoubtedly a convenient tool for finding and sharing the newest research in a given field with immediate effect. All a scientist had to do was post a link to a journal or a preprint server, and 100s-1000s of their colleagues would see it within hours to days, no doubt bolstered by Twitter's (in)famous recommendation algorithm.


My field's relationship with Twitter in general, and Musk in particular, has been even more turbulent. On the one hand,  relevant public health  and life scientists (including epidemiologists, virologists, molecular biologists, evolutionary biologists, disease ecologists) clinicians, and health policy researchers all made use... 
It may be worth revisiting the early promise of social media and the internet at-large "democratizing information," and by extension, science. (Refs)

### Maybe we shouldn't miss it too much?

I can personally attest to how helpful "SciTwitter" was. As graduate students we're told that networking is crucial, and that social media is an increasingly important tool in those endeavors. Particularly being in Public Health graduate school *en pleine pandemie*, hearing from experts around the world at all times kept me far better informed than the largely superficial and sometimes dangerously inaccurate coverage in mainstream media. I watched as Bioinformaticians and Molecular Epidemiologists alerted each other to sequence database outages in real-time. New data on the immunology and epidemiology of the ever-rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains was at my fingertips within days, explained in well written threads by the authors of papers that would've been drowned out among the thousands of preprints and newly published articles in almost every journal, I got to learn about the science of airborne hazard mitigation, from filtration and ventilation to respirator fitting from environmental engineers and industrial hygienists  whom I likely never would have encountered otherwise.

Aside from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, I've lost track of how many times I had a programming issue, fired off a quick Tweet with the right hashtag, and gotten better help than StackOverflow has ever offered in a matter of minutes.


Whatever value we once found on the platform, it's important to remember a lesson many of us learned the hard way: An algorithmic rage machine, however incidentally helpful it may be, is still a rage machine.

## Whither Science Mastodon?

While several science-oriented mastodon instances (e.g. mstdn.science, fediscience, ecoevo.social,... ) have been created before and since the so-called "Twitter Migration" to Mastodon and the broader Fediverse, it is clear that the networks many of us in the sciences had spent years building have largely not be reconstituted. Personally, I left a flag on my Twitter account inviting people to migrate to Mastodon with me for months. Some cherished connections did come over within the first few weeks, even helping me navigate the new platform. But as months went on and the "birdsite" became increasingly unstable and hate-filled under Elon's control 

<!--- Put this in a different post?

### On recentralization, or, don't feed the data parasites

Mastodon has been abuzz with concerns about another problem: the perceived encroachment of the same corporations behind the platforms so many left behind into the Fediverse. Not long after Elon's takeover, Jack Dorsey launched "BlueSky," a comparatively bare bones, invite-only platform based largely on Twitter source. It currently does not federate, but it seems likely that will happen in the future. Of seemingly more urgent concern is the news that "Meta," the parent company of Facebook conveniently rebranded to distance itself from Cambridge Analytica and the sentiment analysis feedback loop-driven organization of several fascist coup attempts around the world, is planning to launch its own social network based on Mastodon's source, with the apparent intention of federating.
